# Brandery
Projects from my summer internship at the Brandery
## [Zid Zid](ZidZid)
I worked with our design intern, [Ben Kolde](https://www.benkolde.com), to redesign Zid Zid's contact form. They asked for a more modern feeling contact form that was still on-brand and engaging to users.

Ben designed the new contact form and I used HTML, CSS and JS to bring his designs to life and integrate it into their Wordpress site and Mailchimp mailing lists.

You can view a PDF of Ben's initial designs [here](ZidZid/Zidzidcontactform.pdf) as well as screenshots of the website before and after [here](ZidZid/BeforeAndAfters.pdf).
